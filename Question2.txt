Q2. Rationalize the results from the risk analysis of the portfolio

Below is the output from the analysis run on a portfolio with $1b CAD XIU and $1b USD SPY.
Average expected return:  13.18 %
Std Dev of forecasted returns 0.1362
1% CVaR:  -21.75 %
%1 ETL based on largest single day loss per path -10.99 %
%1 ETL based on largest overall decrease from initial -33.92 %

The average returns give a good sense for if the numbers are in the right ballpark. The 5yr return of XIU is 10.89% and
SPY is 15.83% as of March 31st 2022. We can see an average of the two returns provide a result of 13.36% showing the
results from the model are in the right ballpark.

Having calculated the 1% ETL (CVaR) of total return to be -21.75%, expected loss of the worst 1% of return is -21.75%
over this coming year. The std dev of the forecasted returns was determined to be 0.1362, given such a large std dev
compared to the average return I want to hypothesize the high volatility is a driving factor in the high tail risk. This
high volatility can be explained by looking at that macro economic climate of the time period of the historic data:
early 2018 US markets saw increase due to corporate tax changes implemented by Trump administrations, 2020 Corona drove
markets to down, 2020-2021 near zero interest rates and quantitative easing, and cyclical open and closing of lockdowns.
Given this perspective the high tail risk reflects the large amount of volatility in the market.

The calculation done on the 1% ETL of largest overall differences from initial investments shows that there is very high
drawdown, with 1% worst results being 33.92%. The number itself can be justified looking at volatility as we did for
CVaR.  This risk metric provides insights into the risk the Teachersâ€™ may face with being underfunded if assets values
fall too quickly over period.

Given the data set used to forecast 2022 yearly return the results is inline with my expectations and understanding.
Given the timeframe over which the historical data was gathered are very different from the current increasing interest
rate and quantitative tightening, I do not think the results will be good indicators of the results we could expect to
see in 2022.
